# python-Simple_Blog_Application

This is a simple blog application created using Flask web framework.
This project helps you to learn about validation using WTForms and tht routing and backend connection using MySQL DB. I have provided db_creation.txt where I have mention each and every step about DB creation.

1. Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

2. MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.

3. WTForms is a flexible forms validation and rendering library for Python web development.
